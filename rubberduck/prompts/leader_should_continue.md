Analyze the provided input text. If the text indicates that a problem or issue has been resolved/solved/completed, return "SOLVED". If the text indicates there are still remaining issues, problems, or work to be done, return "RETRY". 

Look for key indicators such as:
- "SOLVED" indicators: "problem is solved", "issue resolved", "completed successfully", "all tests pass", "no errors found"
- "RETRY" indicators: "issues remain", "failed", "errors", "problems", "not working", "incomplete"

**⚠️ CRITICAL** After your response (SOLVED or RETRY), always include the keyword TERMINATE in a new line.
